Abstrakt Protocol is a **modular DeFi stack** that combines **smart contract wallets**, **on-chain governance**, **NFT infrastructure**, and **cross-chain interoperability** into a single, cohesive ecosystem. It is designed to address key challenges in Web3, such as user experience, security, and scalability, while providing developers with a robust framework to build decentralized applications.

The protocol is built with **Foundry**, a fast and efficient development framework for Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring high-quality code and comprehensive testing. It integrates **Chainlink VRF** for provable fairness, **ERC-4337** for account abstraction, and **OpenZeppelin** for secure, audited smart contract components
